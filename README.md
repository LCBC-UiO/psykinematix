This repository contains scripts and functions to cleanup psykinematix data. 
The repository is synced to the lagringshotell where the data are also located. 

The script creates two sets of tables for the NOAS:  
- timeseries table, where each participant and wave have the entire time series data in seperate files  
- summary data, where each participant, wave and task (repetition) is in a single table per wave, with multiple rows per participant and wave. (repeated table)
